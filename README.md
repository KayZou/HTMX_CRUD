# HTMX and PHP CRUD App

This repository contains a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with HTMX and PHP. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to perform CRUD operations without using JavaScript, relying solely on HTMX for dynamic interactions.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new records to the database.
- **Read:** Retrieve and display records from the database.
- **Update:** Modify existing records in the database.
- **Delete:** Remove records from the database.

## Technologies Used

- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/): A library for high-level AJAX interactions without writing JavaScript.
- PHP: Server-side scripting language for building the backend logic.
